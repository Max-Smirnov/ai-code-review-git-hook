# Updated Implementation Plan - Parameter-Based Trigger

## Overview

This updated implementation plan reflects the simplified approach where AI code review is triggered only when explicitly requested via environment variables or git configuration, ensuring zero impact on IDE workflows.

## Revised Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation with Conditional Trigger (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish project structure with parameter-based activation

#### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Python project structure
- [ ] Set up virtual environment and dependencies
- [ ] Create conditional pre-push hook template
- [ ] Set up development tools (linting, formatting, testing)

#### 1.2 Trigger Detection System
- [ ] Implement environment variable detection (`AI_REVIEW=1`)
- [ ] Add git config detection (`git config ai.review true`)
- [ ] Create trigger validation and logging
- [ ] Build hook bypass logic for normal operations

#### 1.3 Configuration System (Simplified)
- [ ] Implement basic YAML configuration parser
- [ ] Create trigger-specific configuration loading
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Build default configuration with opt-in behavior

**Key Changes from Original Plan**:
- Hook only activates when explicitly requested
- Simplified configuration loading (only when needed)
- Focus on non-intrusive operation

### Phase 2: Git Operations (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Implement git integration with both comparison use cases

#### 2.1 Git Operations Module

  1. Compare with remote target branch
  2. Compare with specified branch (default: main)

### Phase 3: AWS Bedrock Integration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Integrate with AWS Bedrock for AI-powered reviews

#### 3.1 Bedrock Client
- [ ] Implement AWS Bedrock client wrapper
- [ ] Add credential management (AWS CLI, environment, IAM)

### Phase 4: Review Engine with Rule Templates (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Build core review logic and rule processing

#### 4.1 Rule System
- [ ] Create rule template loader
- [ ] Implement file pattern matching
- [ ] Build severity level processing
- [ ] Add context-aware rule selection
- [ ] Create rule override system

#### 4.2 Review Processing
- [ ] Implement review result aggregation
- [ ] Create issue categorization and filtering
- [ ] Build severity-based filtering
- [ ] Add result formatting
- [ ] Create summary generation

**Deliverables**:
- Complete rule template system
- Review processing engine with configurable rules
- Issue categorization and severity handling

### Phase 5: Interactive User Interface (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Create terminal-based interactive interface

#### 5.1 Terminal Interface
- [ ] Build colored terminal output
- [ ] Create progress indicators
- [ ] Implement user prompts (continue/abort/details)
- [ ] Add result display formatting
- [ ] Create help system

#### 5.2 User Experience Flow
- [ ] Implement interactive decision flow
- [ ] Add detailed result views
- [ ] Create summary displays
- [ ] Build error message formatting
- [ ] Add configuration guidance

**Deliverables**:
- Interactive terminal interface
- User-friendly result display
- Clear decision prompts

### Phase 6: Conditional Hook Implementation (Week 6-7)
**Goal**: Create the parameter-triggered pre-push hook

#### 6.1 Hook Script
- [ ] Create conditional pre-push hook script
- [ ] Implement trigger detection logic
- [ ] Add hook context handling
- [ ] Create main execution flow
- [ ] Add proper exit code handling

#### 6.2 Trigger Mechanisms
- [ ] Environment variable trigger (`AI_REVIEW=1`)
- [ ] Git config trigger (`ai.review=true`)
- [ ] Git alias creation utilities
- [ ] Custom command wrapper (`git-ai-push`)

**Hook Logic Flow**:
```python
def main():
    # Check if review is requested
    if not should_run_review():
        sys.exit(0)  # Allow push without review
    
    # Run AI review only when requested
    result = run_ai_review()
    sys.exit(0 if result else 1)
```

### Phase 7: Installation and Setup (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Create easy installation and configuration system

#### 7.1 Installation System
- [ ] Build installation script
- [ ] Create hook deployment to `.git/hooks/`
- [ ] Add git alias setup
- [ ] Implement configuration wizard
- [ ] Create uninstallation process

#### 7.2 User Onboarding
- [ ] Create setup verification
- [ ] Add AWS credential validation
- [ ] Build configuration testing
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting utilities

**Installation Commands**:
```bash
# Install tool
pip install ai-code-review-git

# Install hook in repository
ai-code-review install

# Setup convenient alias
git config alias.ai-push '!f() { AI_REVIEW=1 git push "$@"; }; f'

# Test installation
ai-code-review test
```

### Phase 8: Documentation and Testing (Week 8-9)
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

#### 8.1 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests with mock AWS
- [ ] Hook trigger testing
- [ ] Error scenario testing
- [ ] Performance testing

#### 8.2 Documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Configuration guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Migration guide from other tools

## Key Differences from Original Plan

### Simplified Trigger System
- **Before**: Always-on hook with environment detection
- **After**: Conditional hook with explicit opt-in triggers

### User Experience
- **Before**: Complex IDE integration planning
- **After**: Terminal-focused with zero IDE impact

### Installation
- **Before**: Complex environment detection
- **After**: Simple hook installation with clear triggers

## Usage Examples

### Normal Git Operations (Unchanged)
```bash
# These work exactly as before in IDEs and terminal
git push origin main
git push origin feature-branch
```

### AI-Reviewed Push Operations
```bash
# Environment variable trigger
AI_REVIEW=1 git push origin main

# Git config trigger
git -c ai.review=true push origin main

# Convenient alias
git ai-push origin main

# With specific comparison branch
AI_REVIEW_BRANCH=develop git ai-push origin feature-branch
```

- [ ] Support for both comparison use cases
- [ ] AWS Bedrock integration with multiple models
- [ ] Interactive terminal experience

### User Experience
